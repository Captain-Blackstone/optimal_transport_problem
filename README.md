# optimal_transport_problem
The repository for final project (NLA course) - "Optimal Transport Problem" 

This project is an implementation of the **Sinkhorn** algorithm, proposed in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.0895.pdf. 

Implementation is based on the `POT : Python Optimal Transport` (https://pythonot.github.io/)

Here one can pass the `np.ndarray` data, Google `jax.numpy` data and `scipy.sparse` matrices as a cost matrix.
